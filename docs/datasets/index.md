# Datasets Overview

Ultralytics provides support for various datasets to facilitate computer vision tasks such as detection, instance segmentation, pose estimation, classification, and multi-object tracking. Below is a list of the main Ultralytics datasets, followed by a summary of each computer vision task and the respective datasets.

## [Detection Datasets](detect/index.md)

Bounding box object detection is a computer vision technique that involves detecting and localizing objects in an image by drawing a bounding box around each object.

* [Argoverse](detect/argoverse.md): A dataset containing 3D tracking and motion forecasting data from urban environments with rich annotations.
* [COCO](detect/coco.md): A large-scale dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, and captioning with over 200K labeled images.
* [COCO8](detect/coco8.md): Contains the first 4 images from COCO train and COCO val, suitable for quick tests.
* [Global Wheat 2020](detect/globalwheat2020.md): A dataset of wheat head images collected from around the world for object detection and localization tasks.
* [Objects365](detect/objects365.md): A high-quality, large-scale dataset for object detection with 365 object categories and over 600K annotated images.
* [SKU-110K](detect/sku-110k.md): A dataset featuring dense object detection in retail environments with over 11K images and 1.7 million bounding boxes.
* [VisDrone](detect/visdrone.md): A dataset containing object detection and multi-object tracking data from drone-captured imagery with over 10K images and video sequences.
* [VOC](detect/voc.md): The Pascal Visual Object Classes (VOC) dataset for object detection and segmentation with 20 object classes and over 11K images.
* [xView](detect/xview.md): A dataset for object detection in overhead imagery with 60 object categories and over 1 million annotated objects.

## [Instance Segmentation Datasets](segment/index.md)

Instance segmentation is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and localizing objects in an image at the pixel level.

* [COCO](segment/coco.md): A large-scale dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, and captioning tasks with over 200K labeled images.
* [COCO8-seg](segment/coco8-seg.md): A smaller dataset for instance segmentation tasks, containing a subset of 8 COCO images with segmentation annotations.

## [Pose Estimation](pose/index.md)

Pose estimation is a technique used to determine the pose of the object relative to the camera or the world coordinate system.

* [COCO](pose/coco.md): A large-scale dataset with human pose annotations designed for pose estimation tasks.
* [COCO8-pose](pose/coco8-pose.md): A smaller dataset for pose estimation tasks, containing a subset of 8 COCO images with human pose annotations.

## [Classification](classify/index.md)

Image classification is a computer vision task that involves categorizing an image into one or more predefined classes or categories based on its visual content.

* [Caltech 101](classify/caltech101.md): A dataset containing images of 101 object categories for image classification tasks.
* [Caltech 256](classify/caltech256.md): An extended version of Caltech 101 with 256 object categories and more challenging images.
